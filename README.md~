Mobile robotics project
------------------------

In this project, a Pioneer 3AT Mobile Robot is used to generate a map of a chosen environment.
A graph is built using RRT algorithm and computes a possible path the robot can follow.

  - Path-planning with RRT algorithm (Rapidly exploring random tree)
  - Smoothed path
  - Dynamic obstacle detection using the robot's sonars
