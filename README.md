# Mobile robotics project

## Written in C++ with ROS

A Pioneer 3AT Mobile Robot is used to generate a map of a chosen environment. The code implements a RRT (rapidly exploring random tree) algorithm to generate a path the robot can follow. 

## Features

  - Path-planning
  - Smoothed path
  - Dynamic obstacle detection using the robot's sonars
